The difficulty here is that it takes time proportional to the length 
of the string to compare two strings. If each string has an average
length of $c$, then searching the list will take $cn$ time.

The difficulty can be avoided by first comparing the hash values
before comparing the string. By the property of hash functions only a
small fraction of keys will map to the same hash value. We compare
strings only if the comparison of hash values yields a match. So the
number of string comparisons can be reduced.
