When \proc{Union} is called, we Splice-in \id{B} after \id{A}'s first
node.  While traversing \id{B}, we set the representative for each
node to the representative of \id{A}. Once we reach the last node of
\id{B} is reached, we also set \id{next} to \id{A}'s second node
(which could be \const{NIL}).
